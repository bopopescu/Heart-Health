Heart-Health
============


This application was my submission to the [Million Hearts Risk Challenge](http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/million-hearts-risk-check-challenge/)! This was a contest hosted by Million Hearts and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to create a new application for Americans to find their risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next five years. Entrants in the contest could choose any means to incorporate the APIs that we were given access to, and I chose to create a web application. This repo contains the Django web application Heart Health that I created to enter the contest, as well as a custom Android app that wraps the website. There was stiff competition in the contest, I competed with numerous teams and companies; there were 34 entries. Although Heart Health was not chosen as a finalist, I will be keeping Heart Health running on [hearthealthapp.com](http://www.hearthealthapp.com), as long as I can find free hosting, as an example of my work. I have open sourced the application here on Github now that the contest is over!
