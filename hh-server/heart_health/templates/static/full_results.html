<h3> 1. Obtain a Screening Test: </h3> 
<p class="lead"> The results above are just an estimate. Knowing the results of some common medical tests (cholesterol and blood pressure screening) can allow us to give you exact risk information, and suggestions for what to do next. The following information is requested:
<ul class="lead">
    <li> Cholesterol Levels (HDL, LDL, and Total) </li>
    <li> Blood Pressure (Systolic and Diastolic) </li> 
    {% if user.userprofile.survey.diabetes %}
    <li> Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) - Optional</li>
    {% endif %}
</ul>
<p class="lead"> If you don't have this information from a previous visit to your doctor, don't worry! You can locate a nearby pharmacy or testing location to have the screening tests done.</p>
