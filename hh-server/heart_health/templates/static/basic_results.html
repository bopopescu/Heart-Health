    <p> Based on just the information you gave us so far, we have calculated an estimate of your risk for Cardiovascular Disease. We have estimated that your risk is likely in a lower category. However, knowing the results of some common medical tests (cholesterol and blood pressure screening) can allow us to give you exact risk information and suggestions for what to do next. Please consider locating a screening location to have these tests done.</p>
